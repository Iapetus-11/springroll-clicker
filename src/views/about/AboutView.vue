        After working on some other projects, and hitting a brick wall (my boyfriend and I)
        (girlfriend and I) we brainstormed different things that we could work on together, at least
        temporarily until we could find a big project to dedicate our time to. Lucky for us, our
        obsession with food led to the possibility of making a game dedicated to clicking spring
        rolls. Upon further delegation, we realized we wanted something that could be enjoyed by
        many groups of people, and there Taco Tapper was born. With lots of love, doodles, code, and
        hard work, together we made something that our friends, family, and general taco eaters
        could happily pass time with.

        Taco Tapper is about building your best possible Taco empire with the help of strong arms,
        auto clickers, and hunger!
